// == Part 1 ==
//
// Write some code to allow or deny purchasing an item based on a given age. If
// the purchaser is 18 years or older, then they are allowed to make the
// purchase. If they are younger than 18 then they are not allowed to make the
// purchase.
//
// To acknowledge if the person is allowed to make the purchase, print out "OK
// to purchase". To acknowledge if the person is now allowed to make the
// puchase, print out "cannot purchase".
//
// == Part 2 ==
//
// Write some code that can determine if a person is an adult, child,
// or senior:
// - A person is a child if they are under 18 years old
// - A person is an adult if they are at least 18 years old, and at most 64
//   years old
// - A person is a senior if they are 65 years or older
//
// The code should exhibit this behavior:
// - If the person is a child, then print "child"
// - If the person is an adult, then print "adult"
// - If the person is a senior, then print "senior"
//
// Check your code by changing the age to different values and confirm that the
// correct messages are displayed.
