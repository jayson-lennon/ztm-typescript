// Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for defining functions. They are
// defined using a fat arrow (=>) and can be used in place of traditional
// function expressions. Arrow functions automatically bind the 'this' keyword
// to the parent context, making them useful in event handlers and callback
// functions. They also support implicit return statements for one-liner
// functions, which makes the code more readable.
