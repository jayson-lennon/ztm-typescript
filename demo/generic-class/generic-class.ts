// Generic classes offer the ability to define a class that can work with a
// variety of different data types. By using generic type parameters, you can
// create a single class that can be customized to work with any type of data
// that you need.
//
// Similarly to generic functions, generic classes allow you to write more
// flexible and reusable code, since you don't have to create a separate class
// for every possible data type.
