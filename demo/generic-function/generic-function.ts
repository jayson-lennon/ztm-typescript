// Generic functions are functions that are designed to work with different
// types of data. They allow you to create a function that can be used with
// various types of data without having to write a separate function for each
// type. This makes your code more efficient, reusable, and easier to maintain.
// Generic functions are especially useful when working with collections of
// data, such as arrays, because they allow you to create a function that can
// work with any type of data in the collection.
