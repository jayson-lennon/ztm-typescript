// Type predicates offer a way to determine the type of data based on a
// condition. This is achieved by defining a function that takes a some data as
// an argument, applies type guards, and returns a boolean indicating whether
// the data is a specific type. The function is then used to narrow down the
// type of the variable in subsequent code. Type predicates are useful when
// dealing with union types or other situations where the type of a variable
// may not be known at compile-time. Type predicates allow the type to be
// determined correctly which avoids runtime errors.
