// Tuples provide a way to express an array with a fixed number of elements of
// different types, creating a data structure with multiple different types.
// They can be especially handy when dealing with scenarios such as
// representing coordinates, storing key-value pairs, or returning multiple
// values from a function. Since they are type-checked, TypeScript can ensure
// that the values in the tuple are correct at compile time.
