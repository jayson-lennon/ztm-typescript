// Write a program that calculates the total area of different shapes using
// discriminated unions. Include support for at least squares, rectangles, and
// circles. The functionality to calculate the area of each shape should exist
// in a single function and the function should select the appropriate
// calculation based on the disciminator.
//
// The area of a square: side^2
// The area of a rectangle: width * height
// The area of a circle: Math.PI * radius^2
//
// Make these assertions to check your code:
// - Square with side length of 5 has an area of 25
// - Rectangle with width of 4 and height of 6 has an area of 24
// - Circle with radius of 3 has an area of Math.PI * 9
