// Functions are an essential component of programming that help organize code
// and make it more modular. A function is a block of code that can be called
// multiple times throughout a program with different inputs, allowing you to
// reuse code and save time. Functions can perform specific tasks or return
// values, and they can be used to break down complex problems into smaller,
// more manageable pieces. By using functions, you can reduce redundancy,
// improve code readability, and make it easier to maintain and update your
// code.
