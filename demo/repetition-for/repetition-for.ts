// The `for` loop consists of three expressions separated by semicolons,
// followed by curly braces where the loop body is placed.
//
// for (A;B;C) { }
//
// A: This is evaluated one time when the `for` loop is first encountered.
//    It is typically used to create a loop counter variable.
// B: A boolean expression which is checked _before_ the loop executes
//    the next iteration. This is used to determine whether the loop
//    should continue.
// C: An expression that is evaluated _after_ the loop body executes, on each
//    iteration. It is normally used to increment the loop counter created
//    in (A).
