// Iterators offer a way to traverse the elements of a collection one by one.
// The purpose of iterators is to provide a standard way for accessing and
// iterating over collections, such as arrays or maps, in a language-agnostic
// way. Using iterators, you can iterate over collections in a loop without
// having to worry about the underlying implementation of the collection.
