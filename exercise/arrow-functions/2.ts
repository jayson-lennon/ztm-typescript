// You are developing a small statistics module that needs to calculate the
// average and median of an array of numbers. The array represents the scores
// of students in an exam. You will use arrow functions to find the average and
// median of these scores.
//
// Requirements:
// - Use an arrow function to calculate the average of the numbers in the array.
// - Use an arrow function to calculate the median of the numbers in the array.
// - The array may have an even or odd number of elements, so handle both cases for the median.
// - Print out the average and the median of the scores.

import { strict as assert } from "assert";

const scores: number[] = [85, 92, 88, 74, 91, 77, 89, 95];

// Replace the 0 with a function call to your arrow functions.
const average = 0;
const median = 0;

// Test cases. Use these to check your work.
assert.equal(average, 86.375);
assert.equal(median, 88.5);
