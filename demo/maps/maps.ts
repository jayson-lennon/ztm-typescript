// A `Map` is a data structure that allows you to store data in a key-value
// pair format. Keys in a map must be unique, and each key can map to only one
// value. You can use any type of value as the key, including objects and
// functions. Maps are useful when you want to quickly access data and you are
// able to maintain the key in memory. In situations where you have to search
// (you don't have a key) for the data you need, a difference data structure
// would be more appropriate.
