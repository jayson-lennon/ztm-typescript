// Declaration merging is a way to combine multiple declarations of
// the same entity into a single definition. This allows you to extend existing
// types and interfaces or merge them with new ones. Declaration merging is
// particularly useful when working with third-party libraries or when you need
// to add additional properties or methods to an existing type.
