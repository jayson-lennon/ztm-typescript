// You are tasked with writing a program to calculate the total amount of time
// a user has spent on a web page. An array is provided containing data for
// each user and the duration of each visit in the `durations` array.
//
// Requirements:
// - Use the provided data to sum the values in the `durations` array for each
//   user
// - Take the sum and update the existing `users` array by setting the `total`
//   value to the calculated sum
// - Use at least 1 while loop in your code
