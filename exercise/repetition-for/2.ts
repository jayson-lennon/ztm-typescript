// Implement a sorting algorithm of your choosing to sort the provided array.
// Good introductory sorting algorithms are bubble sort and insertion sort.
//
// To confirm that your algorithm works properly, perform these steps:
// 1. Run your sorting algorithm on the `nums` array
// 2. Assert that the sorted array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
//
