// You are working on a simple access control system that determines whether a
// user has the necessary permissions to access certain features of a website.
// The system checks various conditions such as the user's role, whether they
// are logged in, and whether they have accepted the terms and conditions.
// You'll use Boolean logic to evaluate these conditions and make access
// decisions.
//
// Requirements:
// - For each scenario below, create a boolean expression that evaluates to
//   `true` whenever the user can access the feature, and `false` whenever the
//   user is denied access to the feature:
//   1. When the user is logged in and has accepted the terms, then they can
//      access the feature.
//   2. When the user is logged in but has _not_ accepted the terms, then they
//      _cannot_ access the feature.
//   2. When the user is logged in and is an admin, they can access the feature
