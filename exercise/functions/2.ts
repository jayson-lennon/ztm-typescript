// You are developing a application to manage a set of basic operations related
// to geometric shapes. The application should be able to calculate the area of
// a rectangle, the perimeter of a rectangle, and the area of a circle. You'll
// implement these functions and demonstrate their usage.
//
// Requirements:
// - Define a function named `calculateRectangleArea` that calculates the area
//   of a rectangle by returning the `width` multiplied by the `height`.
// - Define a function named `calculateRectanglePerimeter` that calculates the
//   perimeter of a rectangle by returning the `width + height` and multiplying
//   it by 2
// - Define a function named `calculateCircleArea` that calculates the area of
//   a circle by taking Ï€ (pi) as approximately 3.14 and multiplying it by the
//   `radius` times `radius`.
// - Use these functions to perform some sample calculations and print the
//   results.

import { strict as assert } from "assert";


//
// Test cases
assert.equal(calculateRectangleArea(5, 10), 50);
assert.equal(calculateRectanglePerimeter(5, 10), 30);
assert.equal(calculateCircleArea(7), 153.86);
