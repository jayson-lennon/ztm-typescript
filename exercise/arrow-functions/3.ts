// You are building an event management system that filters and counts events
// based on their type. You have an array of event objects, where each event
// has a type and a name. You need to filter the events by a specific type and
// count how many events match that type. You'll use arrow functions to
// implement this functionality.
//
// Requirements:
// - Use an arrow function to filter the events array array so it only has
//   "click" events.
// - Use an arrow function to count the number of filtered "click" events.
// - Print out the filtered events and the count of matching events.

// Replace the `null` with a function call to your arrow functions.
const clickEvents = null;
const clickEventCount = null;
