// Arrays offer a way to store and manipulate collections of values of the same
// type. They are defined using square brackets and can be populated with
// values at initialization, or later using various methods such as push(),
// splice(), and concat(). Arrays can be of a fixed length or dynamically
// resized as needed, and they can be used with various array methods to
// perform common operations like sorting, filtering, and mapping.
