// Interfaces provide a way to define the shape of objects or classes. They
// define the contracts that objects must follow, specifying the properties and
// methods that an object must have. Interfaces make it easier to write
// type-safe code by providing a way to ensure that objects are of the correct
// shape before they are used in a program. They also allow for code to be more
// modular and reusable, since objects can be easily swapped out as long as
// they adhere to the interface's contract.
