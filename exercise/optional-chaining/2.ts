// You are building a system for managing book reviews in an online bookstore.
// Each book has a review section that may contain nested data about reviewer
// comments, ratings, and review details. Implement a way to safely access
// these nested properties using optional chaining.
//
// Requirements:
// - Use optional chaining to access various properties of the `bookReview` object.
//
// Notes:
// - The property to access is detailed in the code comments.
