// You are developing a system to manage vehicles in a fleet. The system needs
// to handle different types of vehicles, such as cars and trucks. You'll use
// declaration merging to extend the Vehicle interface to include additional
// properties and methods specific to each vehicle type.
//
// Requirements:
// - Define an initial interface Vehicle with the following properties:
//   -  make: A string representing the vehicle's make (e.g., "Honda").
//   -  model: A string representing the vehicle's model (e.g., "Civic").
//   -  year: A number representing the year of manufacture.
// - Use declaration merging to extend the Vehicle interface for Car with
//   additional properties:
//   -  numberOfDoors: A number representing the number of doors on the car.
//   -  hasSunroof: A boolean indicating whether the car has a sunroof.
// - Use declaration merging to extend the Vehicle interface for Truck with
//   additional properties:
//   -  payloadCapacity: A number representing the payload capacity in kilograms.
//   -  numberOfAxles: A number representing the number of axles on the truck.
// - Create instances of Car and Truck, set all properties to any values you'd
//   like, and print their details including the new properties.
//   - Only print the new properties if they are not null.
