// Exceptions are a way to handle errors and unexpected behavior in your code.
// When an exception occurs, it interrupts the normal flow of the program and
// jumps to a predefined error-handling routine. Exceptions can be used to
// catch and handle errors in a way that doesn't crash the program or cause
// unexpected behavior. Exceptions are thrown using the `throw` keyword and
// caught using the `try...catch` statement.
