// Type assertions allow you to tell the compiler that a value should be
// considered a certain type, even if TypeScript cannot infer the type
// automatically. You can use type assertions to help the compiler recognize
// the types of variables, function return types, and more. When using type
// assertions, be sure to only assert types that are actually correct, as
// asserting an incorrect type can lead to runtime errors in your code.
