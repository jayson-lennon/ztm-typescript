// `async/await` allows you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous way.
// The `async` keyword used with a function or closure creates an asynchronous
// context. The `await` keyword can be used inside an asynchronous context to
// wait for a `Promise` to resolve before moving on to the next line of code.
// While waiting, other code outside the function will execute. When the
// promise resolves, the value is returned and assigned to the variable on the
// left side of the `=` sign. This makes it easier to work with asynchronous
// code as you can write code in a more sequential way.
