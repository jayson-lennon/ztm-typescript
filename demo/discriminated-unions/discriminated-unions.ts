// Discriminated unions are a way to declare a type that can have
// different properties or behaviors based on a specific discriminator property.
// Discriminated unions can be defined using the intersection of a set of types
// with a common property, and the property value can be used to determine which
// type to use.

// We can also use entire objects. Using objects creates
// a 'discriminated union'. Unions only allow the type to be one
// option at a time. Combining this with objects allows multiple
// pieces of data to be associated with each individual option.
