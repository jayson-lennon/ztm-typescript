// You are working on an inventory management system that keeps track of items
// in a warehouse. Each item has various properties, such as its name,
// quantity, and location. You need to iterate over the properties of an item
// object and print out the details.
//
// Requirements:
// - Use a for..in loop to iterate over the properties of the item object.
// - Inside the loop, print out each property and its corresponding value in
//   the format: "{property}: {value}".

const item = {
  name: "Laptop",
  quantity: 25,
  location: "Aisle 3, Shelf 2",
};


// Expected Output:
// name: Laptop
// quantity: 25
// location: Aisle 3, Shelf 2
